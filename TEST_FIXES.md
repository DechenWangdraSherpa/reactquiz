# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Timer Component**

   - Added warning color (red) for time â‰¤ 10 seconds
   - Added 'danger' class for low time state
   - Fixed TypeScript type errors
   - Improved component readability

2. **App Component**

   - Fixed initial timer value to 30 seconds
   - Added prevention of multiple answer selections
   - Improved timer reset on game restart
   - Fixed game state transitions
   - Added proper cleanup for timer interval
   - Added proper TypeScript types

3. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Development server must be running on http://localhost:5173
   - Added required dependencies for Playwright browsers
   - Fixed test configuration

## Remaining Tasks

1. Start development server before running tests:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Run tests with development server running:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Test Cases Addressed

- TC006: Timer Countdown
- TC007: Timer Expiry
- TC011b: Timer Visual Feedback
- TC012: Rapid Answer Selection
- TC014b: Timer Data Validation
- TC015: Score Calculation

## Additional Notes

1. The timer warning state (red color) is activated when:

   - Time remaining is 10 seconds or less
   - Warning state includes both color change and 'danger' class

2. Answer selection logic:

   - Only first click is registered
   - 1.5 second delay before advancing to next question
   - Correct answer increases score
   - Game ends after last question or timer expiry

3. Game state management:
   - Proper reset of all states on restart
   - Cleanup of timer interval on component unmount
   - Clear transitions between game states
